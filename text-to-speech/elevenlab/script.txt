Welcome.  This is a very quick demo of how you can install and use keyvault to secure your {cAPI} keys or tokens.
To install keyvault, you can either download the package as a zip file, or you can use git command which is a lot easier.
I am going to demo how to use git to complete the installation in 30 seconds.
Assume you have git on your machine.
You just need to type {b0.5} git clone {b1} {vhttps} {b0.5} github dot com {b1.5} barrychum {b0.5} keyvault.
The package should be downloaded in the folder keyvault.
{ccd} into keyvault.
{ccd} into bash, or {vpwsh} if you are using powershell.
Add current folder to the search path.
Type config keyvault {c--} demo.
This will install keyvault to the default directory with all keys generated.
Take note of the password for the private key.
You are now ready to use keyvault.
